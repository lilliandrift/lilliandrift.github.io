-This GitHub account was created moments ago to operate these repositories. I will be using this account to connect and share code, and dial in code for others to work with.

-The repository viewed here stems from my account that I had just created. Other users will be able to work with the source codes implemented within this space using branches that stem off from the work.

-I was able to clone the repository by clicking file in the top left, then selecting "Clone Repository." (or by doing "CTRL-Shift-O" on my keyboard.) I selected my repository and from there the clone was swiftly created.
